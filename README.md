This is a data-flow oriented library that encapsulates functionality from [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [PointClouds](https://pointclouds.org/).

It has been initially developed for handling ToF based data and interfaces easily to from [Becom Electronics](https://www.becom-group.com/whatwedo/3dsensoren/) cameras, but can be adapted to other use cases easily.
